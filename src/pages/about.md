Hi, I’m Benjamin Rae, a full-stack developer with a passion for SOLID and clean code. Before transitioning into the tech industry, I spent 8 years as an English teacher, and although I still have a passion for teaching, tech has taken over my heart.

My focus is on building high-quality software with a focus on best practices and design patterns. I believe that software should be easy to read, maintain, and scale, and I strive to achieve this in every project I work on.

In addition to my development work, I’m also passionate about entrepreneurship and creating monetizable side projects. I’m always on the lookout for new opportunities to learn and grow as both a developer and an entrepreneur.

When I’m not working on code, you can find me exploring new coffee shops, hiking in the mountains, or enjoying time with my family.

Thanks for visiting my blog, and I hope you find the content helpful and informative. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or ideas for collaboration!
