description: Discover the joy of tinkering. Inspired by a post I read on the habits of great software engineers, I try to explore what I think it means to be a tinkerer and why I think you should be one too.

## The Joy of Tinkering

I’ve just come across [Vadim Kravcenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vkravcenko/)’s post [Habits of Great Software Engineers](https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/habits-of-great-software-engineers)
where he gives opinions the habits of highly effective developers. It’s an interesting read, you should all check it out. I like the fact that what he has to say goes beyond the lines of code that we inevitably have to write as developers.

[Point 3: The Joy of Tinkering](https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/habits-of-great-software-engineers/#joy-of-tinkering) really resonates with me because that’s exactly my plan for 2024.

### What's a Tinkerer?

Since I’m based in Spain, and most of my connections on here are probably Spanish, I take issue with the fact that several online translation services translate the English “**tinkerer**” to the Spanish “**_chapucero_**”. Maybe I’m wrong, but the “**_chapucero_**” has connotations of poor and shoddy workmanship and bodge jobs. It makes me think of rushed and poor quality work.

This really doesn’t fit with the English meaning of **tinkerer** for me. Being a **tinkerer** is really all about experimenting, breaking and fixings things. Maybe this translation comes from the fact that the Marvel comic villain the **Tinkerer** is translated as “**_Chapucero_**”. But here’s an excerpt from the Wikipedia article for the Tinkerer:

> The Tinkerer is generally depicted as a genius in [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) who is able to create [gadgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadget) and other devices from nothing more than spare parts left over from ordinary household appliances.

That doesn’t sound like it fits the bill of a “_**chapucero**_” to me.

I’d recommend that you all start trying to **tinker** more.

If you’re looking for ideas or inspiration then I’d recommend these two resources:

- [codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi) from [John Crickett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johncrickett/)
- [codecrafters.io](http://codecrafters.io)

My plan for the rest of the year is going to be trying to tinker a lot more. I want to explore things that pique my interest and really get my hands dirty. If you want to join in and follow along then [subscribe to my newsletter](https://buttondown.email/benjaminrae).

It's been a short one today, but for now I leave you with this thought:

> Learn how things work, learn what they do, learn how to break them and then learn how to fix them.
