# Setting up a VPS

If you are still using Render, Fly.io, Railway and even Heroku then I propose you stop torturing yourself with and take the opertunity to learn some new skills.

Set up a VPS, learn to use Linux and Docker and your life will be much better for it.

That's it. That's the post.

See you next time!

If only it were that simple.
